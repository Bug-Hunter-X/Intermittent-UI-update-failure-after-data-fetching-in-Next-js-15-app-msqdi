# Intermittent UI Update Failure in Next.js 15 App

This repository demonstrates a bug in a Next.js 15 application where the UI fails to update after fetching data, even though the data is successfully fetched.  The issue is intermittent, making it difficult to debug consistently.

## Bug Description

The application fetches data from an API endpoint using `fetch` within a `useEffect` hook. While the loading state is displayed correctly, the UI sometimes fails to re-render after the data is successfully fetched and assigned to the state variable.  The issue seems to be related to React's batched updates or Next.js's internal mechanisms.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe that the UI might not update correctly with the fetched data after the initial loading screen.

## Potential Solutions (Investigating)

The issue's intermittent nature suggests a possible race condition or subtle timing problem. We are exploring solutions like:

* **Force a re-render:** Using `useState`'s setter function strategically to trigger a re-render might resolve the issue.
* **Strict Mode:** Enabling and disabling React's strict mode to check for potential inconsistencies.
* **Data fetching optimization:** exploring alternative data fetching libraries or methods like `SWR` or `React Query`.

## Solution

The solution involves using the key prop to force a rerender.  The complete solution is provided in the aboutSolution.js file.
